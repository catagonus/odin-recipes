Odin Project foundations course project - html and git practice

My first project for The Odin Project. Created at the end of the HTML Foundations module in the Foundations unit. So far I have learned an introduction to web development, command line basics, git basics, github basics, and html basics. This project is a culmination of the skills I have gained so far.
